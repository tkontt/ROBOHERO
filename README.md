The last programming exercise
The final programming exercise on this course is creating a small game of your own with pygame. The exercise template contains some images for you to use. Please don't use any other images in your game, or others will not be able to test your game based on the source code alone.

The subject of the game is up to you, but it should be about as complicated as the Sokoban example in this part of the material. The game should contain the following features:

The game has a sprite the player can move in some way
The game has some collectable items and/or enemies
The player needs to be set a clear task in the game
The game contains a counter which tells the player how they are doing in the game
The source code for the game is divided into functions like in the Sokoban example.

You need Pyhton and Pygame to play the game.
